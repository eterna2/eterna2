### > "Hello world"

I am a fat and balding middle-age man living in the sunny island-city
[Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore).

> PS: It is not part of [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China)!

I am officially known as [`William`](https://www.babynames.com/name/william),
but a lot of my friends also know me as `eterna2` or `e2` for short.

#### Cats :heart_eyes_cat:

I love animals! I have 5 :smile_cat: at home and used to look after the
community :smirk_cat: in my area (until they all passed away :crying_cat_face:).

#### `eterna2`

I have been using this handle since 1999. It was inspired by a random news
article on the [the first virtual cementery in the world](https://pazeterna.com/).

I am a big fan of
- [DnD](https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd)
- [Rifts](http://palladium-store.com/1001/category/Rifts-RPG.html)
- [Battletech](https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/battletech/)
- and many more tabletop RPGs ...

`Paz Eterna` is my longest running DnD character ever (it lasted thru multiple
editions) and one of my chief inspiration for many of my artworks.
